current status:

devise a way to send yourself errors/feedback on your attempts

find out a way to determine if gpg-agent is active. use this to determine
whether or not to commit from the makefile

Busra uses gpg-agent: super easy, commit from the makefile
Busra does not use it: need to alias. are aliases made in a makefile preserved?
   git commit -S occurs in a script: very tricks
