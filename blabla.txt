current status:

current thing to look into: add yourself under the name Mike Izbicki (or Busra) to the
class as a grader and use your own key to sign the commits. If this doesn't
work, try putting it in your makefile? probably won't work for similar reasons
as my previous ideas did not work.

This all doesnt work. Grading is done seperately to committing. My time has
been wasted, oh no! At least I learned some things about bash, such as when
aliases and functions are used and what export means. and for loops and find
and $arguments in the makefile.
/*
devise a way to send yourself errors/feedback on your attempts

find out a way to determine if gpg-agent is active. use this to determine
whether or not to commit from the makefile

ask busra if she uses gpg-agent, because my first method requires this to be
the case. Ask busra if she commits inside a script, because if she does I
cannot use my second method

Busra uses gpg-agent: super easy, commit from the makefile
Busra does not use it: need to alias. are aliases made in a makefile preserved?
   git commit -S occurs in a script: very tricks


=== Using a function to override ===
not possible if there's an alias over it, apparently. Not a problem if
git commit -S is being run from inside a script.

So:
   if git commit -S is in a script, use a function. Otherwise, use an alias.
   I doubt that they will somehow override each other. It seems like aliases
   are only used when you type them in the prompt without \. if $() is used,
   neither is used

rshell testing program

myprog | rshell | pseudotty
myprog takes a file and passes each line to rshell after it prints it like so:
pass first line, excluding newline.
wait for rshell to eat it up
pass newline
wait for rshell toe at it up
repeat
